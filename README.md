# ntfs-rootfs
A guide on how to use NTFS as the root filesystem on Linux or possibly any other UNIX OS.

Go visit the wiki (on this repository) on how to install and setup.

Currently supported:
* ArchLinux (and derivatives)

QUICK WARNING: This will probably be impractical and/or hard to set up. So it is NOT recommended for new Linux users.

And no, it's not a joke. You can actually do this on a real machine...
